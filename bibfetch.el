;;; bibfetch.el -- Fetch BibTeX entries from Google Scholar

;; Author: Daniel Schoepe
;; Version: 0.1

;;; Commentary:

;; This programs uses the accompanying bibfetch.pl script to fetch
;; BibTeX entries from Google Scholar, and provides some convenience
;; functionality for inserting entries into a bibtex file. See
;; README.org for usage information.

;;; Code:
